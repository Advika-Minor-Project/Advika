## Problem Statement
In these times of Covid-19, where the uncertainty in life has increased and in the current competitive and global world, stress and depression cases are at an all-time high which is affecting a lot of people’s lives. Due to the taboo associated with mental health treatment, people don’t talk about it to anyone or don’t take any treatment. Also, these treatments are not cheap, so there are many factors due to which mental health is ignored a lot of times.
## Quick Start
To get this project up and running locally on your computer:
1. Set up the [Python development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment).
   We recommend using a Python virtual environment.
1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python3` to start Python):
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   python3 manage.py makemigrations
   python3 manage.py migrate
   python3 manage.py runserver
   ```
1. Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to open the admin site
1. Create a few test objects of each type.
1. Open tab to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the main site, with your new objects.
